  notes: "Journal #1\n\nI'm writing these to keep my mind in check. Too many have
    lost themselves to the corrupting powers inside the tower. I will not be one
    of them. \n\nI met one of the goblins in the tower. The eyes were glowing purple.
    Could've sworn I saw something crawling under their skin as well. It jumped me
    and attacked, luckily I dispatched it quickly with my sword. It saddens me to
    kill a creature corrupted by the tower, but that's the only way to free them
    from its grasp."
