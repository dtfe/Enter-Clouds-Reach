  notes: 'My dearest grandchild,


    I hope this note finds you well and in good
    spirits. Your determination to stop the corruption from the tower is admirable.
    I have no doubt that you will accomplish great things, and I am proud of you
    beyond words.


    Enclosed you will find a small trinket that has been in our
    family for generations. It has brought me luck on many occasions, and I hope
    it will do the same for you. Carry it with you always, and may it guide you on
    your journey.


    With love and admiration,

    Grandpa'
